## Introduction

<p align="center"> 

This repository contains the implementation of our method that enhances **Fast Adversarial Training (FAT)** by introducing **Precision-Aware Adversarial Initialization (PAAI)** for robust deep learning models. Our approach significantly improves robustness against strong attacks (e.g., PGD, AutoAttack) while maintaining the computational efficiency of single-step adversarial training.

>**Key Idea**: Instead of using naive random initialization for adversarial perturbations, PAAI generates multiple candidate perturbations using historical guidance and selects the one that maximizes lossâ€”ensuring stronger, more effective adversarial examples from the start.
